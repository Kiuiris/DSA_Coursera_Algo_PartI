Problems:
[Board]
- board is changed after using twin()
    -> probably because of clone()
    -> write own method
- nullpointer exception in neighbors
    -> didn't initialize blankX

Submission 1: [Board only] 5/100 -> API error (user defined method should be private)

[Solver]
- keep getting no solution
    -> didn't initialize solvable as true

Submission 2: [Board only] 10/100 -> pass API and Compilation -> Checkstyle error -> abort

Submission 3: 5/100 -> API error (user defined method should be private)

Submission 4: 31/100
- wrong answer of mahattan() for some boards
    -> use Math.abs(i - x[tile - 1] + j - y[tile - 1]) instead of Math.abs(i - x[tile - 1]) + Math.abs(j - y[tile - 1])
    -> the two right coordinates arrays are only suitable for 3x3 puzzle
