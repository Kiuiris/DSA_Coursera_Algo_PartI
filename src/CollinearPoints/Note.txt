Problems:
[Point]
- return 0 instead of -Infinity when degenerate
    -> subY = 0 so the method instantly return 0
    -> assign -1 to subY
- return -Infinity instead of Infinity when vertical and subY is -
    -> assign 1 to subY
[BruteCollinearPoints]
- if there are 5 points align, print the same segment 5 times.
    -> reduce to 4 times (temporarily ignore this cuz there wont be any 5 collinear points.)
- wrong answer with input8.txt
    -> wrong use of continue/break in the third for loop
    -> fixed

[FastCollinearPoints]
- print wrong answer
    -> fixed by getting pExcluded[end - 1] instead of pExcluded[end]
- both arguments to LineSegment constructor are the same point: (3000, 7000) -> fixed by sorting 'sorted' again in the loop
- if there are 5 points align, print every time. (can't use ArrayList.contains() cuz there is no equals method in LineSegment)
    -> adding condition to add a new segment

Submission 1: 87/100
remaining problems:
    - throw exception when there are duplicate points
    - throws an exception if either constructor argument is null or any entry in array is null
    - throw NullPointerException instead of IllegalArgumentException in Point???
    - data type mutated the points[] array - data type should have no side effects unless documented in API
